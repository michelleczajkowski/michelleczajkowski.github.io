A study recently published in cooperation with environmental organizations WeGreen and Home Proud <span class="red" data-word="show">show</span> that, at least within city centres, efforts to better insulate an apartment are highly <span class="red" data-word="positive">positive</span> associated with an increased feeling of inclusion in the neighbourhood. There is already ample evidence that measures such as replacing single-pane windows and closing curtains at night are <span class="red" data-word="affective">affective</span> ways of lowering heating costs by insulating homes <span class="red" data-word="for">for</span> cold. However, this is the first study which also examines the psychological effects of these measures.<br><br><br><br>The study asked participants from fifteen neighbourhoods in three cities responded to an online questionnaire. In total, over 500 questionnaires <span class="red" data-word="have been completed">have been completed</span>. Participants were asked about how they <span class="red" data-word="insulate">insulate</span> their home and how much they save in terms of gas, hot water, and money. Additionally, they were asked to describe <span class="red" data-word="they're">they're</span> neighbourhood and what they like about living there. They were asked to <span class="red" data-word="indiate">indiate</span> the degree to which they agreed with a number of different statements, e.g., "I would like to know my neighbours more."<br><br><br><br>The results showed that insulating ones home was associated with more positive feelings about one’s residential area, an effect that was greater if a person <span class="red" data-word="would own">would own</span> their own apartment. The researchers believe that such home improvement efforts provide a feeling of being in control over one's environment, weather financial, social or physical. Previous research shows, unsurprisingly, that its people who feel most part of a neighbourhood who take the <span class="red" data-word="initiative">initiative</span> to pick up litter, plant flowers, and push the local government to make repairs to the road and pavement.<br><br>
