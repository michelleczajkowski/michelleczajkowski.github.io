    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Writing is usually assessed by examining the end product only. However, problems that are visible in the final written product 
        are sometimes only symptoms of something going wrong in the writing process. Think, for example, on surface-level errors in mechanics. 
        Are they due to inattention? Running out of time? The writer's inability to 'see' errors? Or gaps in the writer's language knowledge? 
        Only the writing process can reveal the answer. </p>

    <p>It is increasingly easy to capture the writing process, due to accessbility of 
        keystroke logging and screen capture technology. In many instances, we already capture the writing process 
        as part of computer-based assessment proctoring systems. We are reaching a point where language assessors and 
        instructors will be able to, if appropriate to the testing purpose, provide feedback on the writing process. </p>
    <p>In assessment contexts 
        which aim to provide detailed and helpful feedback to learners, this could be very helpful. Raters could access 
        both the written output and recordings of the writing process. Rating rubrics could include criteria related to planning, 
        time management, and revision efficiency, for example. Teachers and course designers could also gain a better idea of 
        what students are struggling with. As much of writing didactics focus on <i>how</i> to write, this would be useful information.</p>

        

    
    <h2>This website</h2>
    <p>This website introduces a study to explore different ways in which the writing process can be evaluated and assessed in formative or diagnostic contexts. It provides
        an example of student writing, and then a video (8x speed) of the text being written. Many teachers and testers may never have seen such a video in full, and 
        find it insightful. What advice would you give the writer based only on the text itself? How would that change / expand after having seen the video?
