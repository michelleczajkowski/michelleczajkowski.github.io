<h1>Revision Test</h1>
<p>A classmate asked you to check their writing. You open the file on your computer. You notice that:
    <br>1: The spelling and grammar checker has found some errors.<br>
    2: There are some <i>other</i> errors that the checker did not catch. <br><br> You will need to correct both, using your language skills and your skillful use of spelling and grammar checkers.
    First, a short tutorial. For each error below, accept, change or ignore the advice.</p>
<h2>Tutorial 1 of 3: Accepting or Ignoring Advice</h2>
<p id="sentence">A study recently published by in cooperation with environmental organizations WeGreen and Home Proud <span class="red" data-word="show">show</span> that, at least within city centres, efforts to better insulate an apartment are highly <span class="red" data-word="positive">positive</span> associated with an increased feeling of inclusion in the neighbourhood. There is already ample evidence that measures such as replacing single-pane windows and closing curtains at night are <span class="red" data-word="affective">affective</span> ways of lowering heating costs by insulating homes <span class="red" data-word="for">for</span> cold. However, this is the first study which also examines the psychological effects of these measures.

    <br><br>The study asked participants from fifteen neighbourhoods in three cities responded to an online questionnaire. In total, over 500 questionnaires <span class="red" data-word="have been completed">have been completed</span>. Participants were asked about how they <span class="red" data-word="insulate">insulate</span> their homes, but also how much they save in terms of gas, hot water, and money. Additionally, they were asked to describe <span class="red" data-word="they're">they're</span> neighbourhood and what they like about living there. They were asked to <span class="red" data-word="indiate">indiate</span> the degree to which they agreed with a number of different statements, e.g., "I would like to know my neighbours more."
    
   <br><br> The results of the study indicate firstly that residents took more actions to insulate their homes than expected, <span class="red" data-word="a">a</span> expected effect of a result of last years high gas prices. The results also indicate that insulating one's home was associated with more positive feelings about one's residential area.
    
   <br><br> It is important to note that this effect was greater if a person <span class="red" data-word="would own">would own</span> their own apartment. Previous study's show that homeowners are both more likely to proactive insulate their homes then renters who view that as the owner's responsibility and feel a sense of belonging in a neighbourhood. However, the results of this study show a relationship between insulation efforts and this feeling. In other words, residents <span class="red" data-word="which">which</span> owned their apartment but took few or no steps to insulate their homes had lower measures of neighbourhood <span class="red" data-word="belonging">belonging</span>.
    
   <br><br> The researchers believe that such home improvement efforts provide a feeling of being in control over one's environment, weather financial, social or physical. This conclusion has <span class="red" data-word="impulcatns">impulcatns</span> for improving other aspects of a neighbourhood as well. Previous research shows, unsurprisingly, that its people who feel most part of a neighbourhood who take the <span class="red" data-word="initiative">initiative</span> to pick up litter, plant flowers, and push the local government to make repairs to the road and pavement.
    
   <br><br> The government already provides financial incentives for <span class="red" data-word="pesidents">pesidents</span> to take environmentally friendly actions, for example reducing use of cars. The same could be done for the insulating of homes. If the government would reduce the cost of insulating measures, it could benefit people in a number of different ways.</p>
