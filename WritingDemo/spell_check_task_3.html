    <div id="text-container">
        A study recently published by in cooperation with environmental organizations WeGreen and Home Proud shows that, at least within city centres, efforts to better insulate an apartment are highly positively associated with an increased feeling of inclusion in the neighbourhood.</span> There is already ample evidence that measures such as replacing single-pane windows and closing curtains at night are effective ways of lowering heating costs by insulating homes against cold. However, this is the first study which also examines the psychological effects of these measures.
<br><br>
        The study asked participants from fifteen neighbourhoods in three cities <span class="highlighted">responded</span> to an online questionnaire. In total, over 500 questionnaires were completed. Participants were asked about how they insulate their homes, but also how much they save in terms of gas, hot water, and money. Additionally, they were asked to describe their neighbourhood and what they like about living there. They were asked to indicate the degree to which they agreed with a number of different statements, e.g., "I would like to know my neighbours more."
        <br><br>
        The results of the study show firstly that residents took more actions to insulate their homes than expected, an expected effect of a result of last <span class="highlighted">years</span> high gas prices. The results also indicate that insulating one's home was associated with more positive feelings about one's residential area.
        <br><br>
        It is important to note that this effect was greater if a person owned their own apartment. Previous <span class="highlighted">study's</span> show that homeowners are both more likely to <span class="highlighted">proactive</span> insulate their homes <span class="highlighted">then</span> renters, who view that as the owner's responsibility and feel a sense of belonging in a neighbourhood. However, the results of this study show a relationship between insulation efforts and this feeling. In other words, residents who owned their apartment but took few or no steps to insulate their homes had lower measures of neighbourhood belonging.
        <br><br>
        The researchers believe that such home improvement efforts provide a feeling of being in control over one's environment, <span class="highlighted">weather</span> financial, social or physical. This conclusion has implications for improving other aspects of a neighbourhood as well. Previous research shows, unsurprisingly, that its people who feel most part of a neighbourhood who take the initiative to pick up litter, plant flowers, and push the local government to make repairs to the road and pavement.
        <br><br>
        The government already provides financial incentives for residents to take environmentally friendly actions, for example reducing use of cars. The same could be done for the insulating of homes. If the government <span class="highlighted">would reduce</span> the cost of insulating measures, it could benefit people in a number of different ways.
