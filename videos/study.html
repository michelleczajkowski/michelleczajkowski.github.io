    <h1>The Study: The Diagnostic "Added Value" of Observing the Writing Process</h1>
    <p>A key issue in the diagnostic assessment of writing is that, generally, 
        only the written product is accessible to assessors and teachers. In this study, I ask: 
        <br><br>Would having access to the process add value 
    to a diagnostic assessment of students' writing?</p>
        <h2>Data Collected</h2>
        <p>As part of today's workshop I will be collecting data. 
            You will be asked to score tasks and to write notes and comments. 
            These will be collected the old fashioned way - on paper. Please write clearly :D  <br> <br>
            Your input will be anonymous. 
        </p>
                <br>Goals: <br>To collect judgements on a sample of student academic texts. <br>
            To look <i>behind the scenes</i> to see how problems in the text arise in the writing process. <br>
            To introduce some useful software and methodology for teachers of writing. <br><br>The menu on the left will take you through today's exercises.
